**Project Title:** OpenScience Validation Protocol (OSVP)

**## Vision** OSVP is an open-source initiative designed to combat AI hallucinations and human bias in science. As AI models generate hypotheses at unprecedented rates, we are building a transparent infrastructure to validate claims and protect breakthrough ideas from systemic bias.

**## The Problem: The "Double Error"** We are solving what founder Juan Carlos Paredes calls the "Double Error Problem":

1. **AI Hallucinations:** Inaccurate or fabricated information generated by models.
    
2. **Paradigm Lock:** Human expert consensus rejecting correct but revolutionary ideas (e.g., the history of bacteria and ulcers).
    

**## How It Works** OSVP operates at the level of individual "atomic claims" rather than entire papers. The system is designed to:

- **Deconstruct:** Break scientific content into specific, verifiable assertions.
    
- **Score:** Analyze each claim for risk, novelty, and potential impact.
    
- **Route:** Send claims to a decentralized network of human experts for rapid validation.
    

**## Key Feature: The Anti-Innovator's Dilemma Shield** To prevent "expert bias," this protocol identifies potentially paradigm-shifting ideas and routes them to a diverse group of reviewers, including early-career researchers and experts from adjacent fields.

**## Roadmap**

- [ ] MVP: Atomic claim extraction
    
- [ ] MVP: Basic risk/novelty scoring
    
- [ ] Alpha: Decentralized routing prototype
    

**## Join the Movement** The future of this infrastructure is up to the open-source community. If this community effort gains traction, OSVP will remain a fully open-source public good.
